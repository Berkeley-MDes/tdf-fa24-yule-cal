After Tuesday's class, I reviewed the class materials and Grasshopper notes in more detail to further structure the diagrams. I then worked on organizing and simplifying the diagrams for better clarity.

Thie week, I explored Rhino 3D and Grasshopper more and tried to figure out the system of files shared.

I’ve understood that the task involves creating diagrams to represent the example files, and it’s important to explore different approaches while being open to experimentation and learning from early failures. The process includes steps like setting up the plane, adjusting parameters, manipulating the geometry, and testing the design for stability and volume. It’s essential to focus on key elements like sphere positioning, void subtraction, and parameter adjustments, while refining the final model for 3D printing. I’ll review everything again tomorrow to make sure it’s on track.

To begin, I left the void width and height unchanged, as they were already suitable for the design. Then, I adjusted the parameters for phone width, length, corner radius, and thickness to align with the exact specifications of my iPhone 15. Following this, I fine-tuned the center Z values for both Sphere 1 and Sphere 2, ensuring the height was appropriate for the stand’s overall structure. Additionally, I modified the radius and length of the cylinder to match the dimensions of my phone more accurately.

While adjusting the parameters, I accidentally made an error where the phone buttons became separated from the phone frame. I tried several times to fix it, but couldn’t figure out how to resolve the issue. I decided to leave it as is, knowing I could ask about it during the next class session.

Once the adjustments were complete, I pressed Bake Me to finalize the changes and baked the model into the design. To further organize and review the outcome, I created a separate layer titled iPhone 15 to visualize and verify the results. This layer allowed me to clearly inspect how the modified parameters fit with the overall design, ensuring the stand would securely hold my phone while maintaining stability.
