# Week 1
# Week of 09/05/2024
This week, I completed General Workshop Safety training and printed a sample using a laser cutter. 

# Reflection
As an international student, I’m still adjusting to the classes at Berkeley, so it’s been a bit overwhelming. I haven’t come across anything particularly surprising yet. I completed the General Workshop Safety online training as part of the assignments, but I struggled with using the equipment, specifically with the laser cutter. Thankfully, my cohort member Josh Jang helped me with printing, and I’m very grateful for his assistance.

# Speculations
Recently, I bought an electric bike and have been debating whether to buy a basket to carry a bag, but I’m considering making one through the Jacobs Makerspace instead.
