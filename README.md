This week, we received the PARTICLE customizable IoT kit. I’ve heard of Particle, a company that specializes in IoT (Internet of Things) solutions. They offer a complete platform for developing, connecting, and managing IoT devices, providing tools like development kits, cloud services, and connectivity options. Particle is well-known for its hardware modules, such as the Photon and Boron, which are designed for both hobbyist and industrial use, supporting everything from prototypes to large-scale deployments.

I’m already familiar with this type of IoT kit, as I have prior experience developing an IoT device for posture correction (more details can be found [here](https://www.yulekim.bio/keeper)). However, during that project, we used Arduino rather than Visual Studio Code, and my focus was more on user experience design and Project Manager rather than the actual coding itself.

Last time, I connected the kit to my laptop and learned the basics, such as printing “Hello World” through Visual Studio Code. Now, I’m working on getting more familiar with the Visual Studio Code platform. Next week, there’s a specific topic set, and I plan to explore the platform further and experiment with something fun.

My Interaction Ecosystems

For this assignment, I was tasked with analyzing my daily media and entertainment ecosystem, focusing on how I use various devices and applications throughout the day. The goal was to break down my app usage, categorize it, and then creatively represent these categories using abstract symbols. This process helped me not only understand my screen time but also reflect on how different areas of my digital life interact with one another.

Devices and Screen Time Analysis
First, I began by identifying the digital devices I primarily use: my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. I accessed the Screen Time feature on each of these devices to see which apps I use most frequently.

Abstract Representation of Categories
After categorizing the apps and calculating their usage percentages, I moved on to the creative step: selecting abstract objects that could represent these categories and their proportions.

Gears (Social, Productivity & Finance, Utility)
First, I chose gears to represent Social, Productivity & Finance, and Utility. The gears symbolize how these areas of my life are interconnected, with Social being the largest gear driving the others. This highlights how these categories work together to keep my digital life functioning smoothly.

Tree (Entertainment, Shopping & Food, Education)
Next, I used a tree metaphor to represent Entertainment, Shopping & Food, and Education. Entertainment, being the largest category, is depicted as the tree’s lush leaves, while Shopping & Food serves as the branches that support it. Education forms the roots, symbolizing foundational growth.

Sand Timer (Social, Entertainment, Productivity & Finance)
Finally, I chose a sand timer to show the relationship between Social, Entertainment, and Productivity & Finance. Social is the wide upper chamber, reflecting the largest portion of my time, while Entertainment flows through the middle, balancing with work. Productivity & Finance is concentrated at the bottom, symbolizing its essential but compressed role.

Reflection and Alignment with Assignment Goals
By categorizing my app usage, calculating the percentages, and using abstract objects like gears, a tree, and a sand timer, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of my digital habits. The assignment encouraged me to reflect not just on my screen time, but also on the balance and interaction between productivity, social activities, and entertainment.

Project Overview: Bottle Holder Design

This project started with a simple problem: after pouring water from my bottle, moisture would always collect at the bottom, leaving annoying marks on surfaces. I wanted to solve this everyday issue by designing a 3D-printed holder that would keep the bottle dry and stable on any surface.

Challenges & Solutions:

I explored Grasshopper for computational design, trying different geometric combinations to create the final holder. Initially, I attempted to 3D-scan the bottle for precision but eventually switched to manual modeling after encountering several issues. Iteration was key—fine-tuning parameters in Grasshopper made a huge difference in getting the design right.

Results & Feedback:

The final design worked as intended, solving the moisture issue while being functional and aesthetically pleasing. Feedback from peers encouraged me to experiment with more shapes, make the design adjustable for different bottle sizes, and explore more durable materials for better heat resistance.

Conclusion:

This project was a great learning experience. I got hands-on with Grasshopper and Rhino, and despite some failed attempts along the way (looking at you, 3D-scanning!), the process taught me the value of persistence and iteration. It’s more than just a bottle holder—it’s about solving real problems with practical design and pushing my skills in computational design.

# Week 2
# Week of 09/12/2024

After Tuesday's class, I reviewed the class materials and Grasshopper notes in more detail to further structure the diagrams. I then worked on organizing and simplifying the diagrams for better clarity.

During the last class, I relearned how to adjust values using the Control Panel, which made it easier for me to fine-tune my desired design. By the way, recently, a new iPhone was released. I have always thought that my current phone is smaller than my hand size, so I'm considering purchasing the new, bigger iPhone model. Therefore, I adjusted the width, height, and thickness values to match the size of the iPhone Pro Max.

![Screenshot-2024-09-12-at-2 55 22 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/673758ef-d27a-4287-906a-52ebced9a6a7)

While working, I came up an idea: what if the phone stand could allow viewing from multiple angles rather than being fixed at just one? So I focused on this, and after several attempts, I adjusted the values to enable the phone to be positioned at both steeper and graduer angles."

<img width="970" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 2 55 58 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22996ec8-5c54-4a4d-b6c8-3c1851ff6157">

After baking the model, I was able to identify the design I wanted. However, there was one issue. To allow the phone to be placed at a more gradual angle, a groove, marked in red, needed to be carved out to fit the phone. Next week, I plan to study Rhino and try to create this groove to match my (future) phone's thickness.

# Week of 09/10/2024

Thie week, I explored Rhino 3D and Grasshopper more and tried to figure out the system of files shared.

<img width="1350" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-08 at 9 46 12 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f09cfc8d-43a9-47f7-9b7c-2a57fbeec24a">

I’ve understood that the task involves creating diagrams to represent the example files, and it’s important to explore different approaches while being open to experimentation and learning from early failures. The process includes steps like setting up the plane, adjusting parameters, manipulating the geometry, and testing the design for stability and volume. It’s essential to focus on key elements like sphere positioning, void subtraction, and parameter adjustments, while refining the final model for 3D printing. I’ll review everything again tomorrow to make sure it’s on track.

<img width="1020" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-08 at 9 17 16 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb3c7e68-68fc-4d7b-be55-22b491dd7588">

To begin, I left the void width and height unchanged, as they were already suitable for the design. Then, I adjusted the parameters for phone width, length, corner radius, and thickness to align with the exact specifications of my iPhone 15. Following this, I fine-tuned the center Z values for both Sphere 1 and Sphere 2, ensuring the height was appropriate for the stand’s overall structure. Additionally, I modified the radius and length of the cylinder to match the dimensions of my phone more accurately.

<img width="774" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-08 at 9 29 46 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/791af10b-02f7-4dd8-8549-26f3192a364b">

While adjusting the parameters, I accidentally made an error where the phone buttons became separated from the phone frame. I tried several times to fix it, but couldn’t figure out how to resolve the issue. I decided to leave it as is, knowing I could ask about it during the next class session.

<img width="766" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-08 at 9 22 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/217209ee-8333-4c63-9030-03bbaea9bb3f">

Once the adjustments were complete, I pressed Bake Me to finalize the changes and baked the model into the design. To further organize and review the outcome, I created a separate layer titled iPhone 15 to visualize and verify the results. This layer allowed me to clearly inspect how the modified parameters fit with the overall design, ensuring the stand would securely hold my phone while maintaining stability.


# Week 1
# Week of 09/05/2024
This week, I completed General Workshop Safety training and printed a sample using a laser cutter. 

# Reflection
As an international student, I’m still adjusting to the classes at Berkeley, so it’s been a bit overwhelming. I haven’t come across anything particularly surprising yet. I completed the General Workshop Safety online training as part of the assignments, but I struggled with using the equipment, specifically with the laser cutter. Thankfully, my cohort member Josh Jang helped me with printing, and I’m very grateful for his assistance.
