# Week 2
# Week of 09/12/2024

After Tuesday's class, I reviewed the class materials and Grasshopper notes in more detail to further structure the diagrams. I then worked on organizing and simplifying the diagrams for better clarity.

During the last class, I relearned how to adjust values using the Control Panel, which made it easier for me to fine-tune my desired design. By the way, recently, a new iPhone was released. I have always thought that my current phone is smaller than my hand size, so I'm considering purchasing the new, bigger iPhone model. Therefore, I adjusted the width, height, and thickness values to match the size of the iPhone Pro Max.

While working, I came up an idea: what if the phone stand could allow viewing from multiple angles rather than being fixed at just one? So I focused on this, and after several attempts, I adjusted the values to enable the phone to be positioned at both steeper and graduer angles."

After baking the model, I was able to identify the design I wanted. However, there was one issue. To allow the phone to be placed at a more gradual angle, a groove, marked in red, needed to be carved out to fit the phone. Next week, I plan to study Rhino and try to create this groove to match my (future) phone's thickness.

Thie week, I explored Rhino 3D and Grasshopper more and tried to figure out the system of files shared.

I’ve understood that the task involves creating diagrams to represent the example files, and it’s important to explore different approaches while being open to experimentation and learning from early failures. The process includes steps like setting up the plane, adjusting parameters, manipulating the geometry, and testing the design for stability and volume. It’s essential to focus on key elements like sphere positioning, void subtraction, and parameter adjustments, while refining the final model for 3D printing. I’ll review everything again tomorrow to make sure it’s on track.

To begin, I left the void width and height unchanged, as they were already suitable for the design. Then, I adjusted the parameters for phone width, length, corner radius, and thickness to align with the exact specifications of my iPhone 15. Following this, I fine-tuned the center Z values for both Sphere 1 and Sphere 2, ensuring the height was appropriate for the stand’s overall structure. Additionally, I modified the radius and length of the cylinder to match the dimensions of my phone more accurately.

While adjusting the parameters, I accidentally made an error where the phone buttons became separated from the phone frame. I tried several times to fix it, but couldn’t figure out how to resolve the issue. I decided to leave it as is, knowing I could ask about it during the next class session.

Once the adjustments were complete, I pressed Bake Me to finalize the changes and baked the model into the design. To further organize and review the outcome, I created a separate layer titled iPhone 15 to visualize and verify the results. This layer allowed me to clearly inspect how the modified parameters fit with the overall design, ensuring the stand would securely hold my phone while maintaining stability.


# Week 1
# Week of 09/05/2024
This week, I completed General Workshop Safety training and printed a sample using a laser cutter. 

# Reflection
As an international student, I’m still adjusting to the classes at Berkeley, so it’s been a bit overwhelming. I haven’t come across anything particularly surprising yet. I completed the General Workshop Safety online training as part of the assignments, but I struggled with using the equipment, specifically with the laser cutter. Thankfully, my cohort member Josh Jang helped me with printing, and I’m very grateful for his assistance.

# Speculations
Recently, I bought an electric bike and have been debating whether to buy a basket to carry a bag, but I’m considering making one through the Jacobs Makerspace instead.
